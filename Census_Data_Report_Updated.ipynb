    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** U.S. Census Bureau - American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2019-2023)  \n",
    "**Acquisition Date:** December 2024  \n",
    "**Method:** API access via `tidycensus` R package  \n",
    "**Geographic Level:** Census Tract (Onondaga County, NY)  \n",
    "**API Documentation:** https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5/profile  \n",
    "**tidycensus Package:** https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Used R for Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Census data was acquired using R's `tidycensus` package rather than Python due to its specialized functionality for accessing U.S. Census Bureau APIs. The `tidycensus` package simplifies the process of authenticating with the Census API, automatically handles variable code lookups, and retrieves both estimates and margins of error in a structured format. After downloading the data in R, we exported it to CSV format for subsequent analysis in Python. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage R's specialized Census tools while maintaining our primary analysis workflow in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables Downloaded\n",
    "\n",
    "We downloaded two American Community Survey (ACS) data profile tables for all Census tracts in Onondaga County, New York. **DP03 (Selected Economic Characteristics)** provides data on median household income, poverty rates, SNAP (food stamp) usage, and employment status. **DP04 (Selected Housing Characteristics)** contains information on housing age, specifically the percentage of housing units built before 1980 and before 1960, which serves as a proxy for heating system efficiency and weatherization needs. These tract-level data will be aggregated to the neighborhood level to align with our heating violations and rental registry analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Census Tract to Neighborhood Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Census data is organized by Census Tract (approximately 70 tracts in Onondaga County), while our analysis requires neighborhood-level aggregation (50 Syracuse neighborhoods). We will map Census tracts to neighborhoods using spatial joins based on geographic boundaries, then aggregate tract-level statistics to the neighborhood level using appropriate weighting methods. This process ensures consistency across all datasets in our final vulnerability index."

    "## Variable Selection Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Vulnerability Indicators:\n",
    "1. **Median Household Income** - Direct measure of economic resources\n",
    "2. **Poverty Rate** - Percentage below federal poverty line\n",
    "3. **SNAP Rate** - Indicator of food insecurity and low income\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these three?**\n",
    "- Together they capture different dimensions of economic hardship\n",
    "- Median income shows central tendency but can miss extremes\n",
    "- Poverty rate captures proportion in severe hardship\n",
    "- SNAP usage indicates households receiving government assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Housing Age Indicators:\n",
    "1. **Pre-1980 Housing** - Likely to have inefficient heating systems\n",
    "2. **Pre-1960 Housing** - Very likely to need weatherization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why housing age matters for winter vulnerability:**\n",
    "- Older buildings have poor insulation\n",
    "- Outdated heating systems (pre-energy efficiency standards)\n",
    "- More likely to have heating failures\n",
    "- Higher energy costs for residents\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geographic Alignment Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge:** Census tracts don't align perfectly with neighborhood boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Approach:**\n",
    "1. Used tract centroids (geographic center points)\n",
    "2. Assigned tract to neighborhood if centroid falls within neighborhood polygon\n",
    "3. For 14 tracts with centroids outside neighborhoods, calculated overlap area and assigned to neighborhood with maximum overlap\n",
    "4. Result: All 69 Syracuse tracts assigned to exactly one neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** Some neighborhoods span multiple tracts; some tracts span multiple neighborhoods. Our aggregation assumes tract characteristics are uniform within the tract, which is an approximation.\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This Census data will be merged with:\n",
    "- `heating_violations_by_neighborhood.csv` (heating risk scores)\n",
    "- `rental_compliance_by_neighborhood.csv` (landlord compliance)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the **final Winter Vulnerability Index** combining:\n",
    "- Heating violations (25 points)\n",
    "- Rental non-compliance (20 points)  \n",
    "- Economic vulnerability (25 points)\n",
    "- Housing age (30 points)\n",

    "## Component 3: Census Data - Economic Vulnerability & Housing Age\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status:** Complete  \n",
    "**Coverage:** 35 neighborhoods (100% coverage)  \n",
    "**Source:** American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (2019-2023)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Acquisition Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Census data was acquired using R's `tidycensus` package to access the Census Bureau API. We downloaded two data profile tables at the Census tract level for Onondaga County:\n",
    "- **DP03:** Selected Economic Characteristics\n",
    "- **DP04:** Selected Housing Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic Alignment Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Census data is organized by Census tract (~70 tracts in Onondaga County), while our analysis requires neighborhood-level aggregation (~35 Syracuse neighborhoods). We performed spatial mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loaded tract geometry:** Census TIGER shapefiles for tract boundaries\n",
    "2. **Loaded neighborhood geometry:** Syracuse Open Data neighborhood boundaries\n",
    "3. **Coordinate transformation:** Aligned both datasets to WGS 84 (EPSG:4326)\n",
    "4. **Spatial join:** Assigned tracts to neighborhoods using tract centroids\n",
    "5. **Handled edge cases:** For 14 tracts with centroids outside neighborhoods, calculated overlap area and assigned to neighborhood with maximum overlap\n",
    "6. **Result:** All 69 Syracuse-area tracts mapped to exactly one neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables Extracted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Vulnerability Indicators:**\n",
    "- Median household income\n",
    "- Poverty rate (percentage below federal poverty line)\n",
    "- SNAP usage rate (percentage of households receiving food stamps)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Housing Age Indicators:**\n",
    "- Percentage of housing built before 1980\n",
    "- Percentage of housing built before 1960\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** Older housing stock (pre-1980) predates modern energy efficiency standards and is more likely to have inadequate insulation and inefficient heating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Tract-level data was aggregated to neighborhoods using appropriate methods for each variable type:\n",
    "- **Median household income:** Median of tract-level medians (income distributions are skewed)\n",
    "- **Poverty rate:** Population-weighted mean (larger tracts weighted proportionally)\n",
    "- **SNAP rate:** Population-weighted mean\n",
    "- **Housing age:** Simple mean (assumes uniform housing distribution within tracts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Economic vulnerability and housing age are geographically concentrated\n",
    "- Neighborhoods with high heating violations also show elevated poverty rates\n",
    "- Significant proportion of Syracuse housing stock predates energy efficiency standards\n",
    "- Census data provides 100% neighborhood coverage (no missing data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging with Heating and Rental Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Census neighborhood features were merged with the previously integrated heating and rental dataset using neighborhood name as the join key. Before merging, a naming conflict was resolved: \"Hawley Green\" and \"Hawley-Green\" appeared as separate entries in the heating and rental data due to inconsistent naming in the source violations dataset. These were combined into a single neighborhood by summing their violation and rental counts. The \"Unknown\" category was also removed as it does not represent a real neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final merge was performed as an outer join to ensure no neighborhoods were lost from either side. The resulting dataset contains 32 neighborhoods. Of these, 28 neighborhoods have complete data across all three sources. Franklin Square and Hawley Green have heating and rental data but no Census coverage, likely because they were not captured in the tract-to-neighborhood spatial mapping. South Campus and Winkworth have Census data only, as no heating violations or rental registry entries were recorded for these areas during the analysis period."
